# RWR-Sparse implementation for fine-tuning 2D Diffusion Model.

This project implements Reward Weighted Regression Sparse method proposed in the [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.13301.pdf) Training Diffusion Models with Reinforcement Learning. It uses [Tiny Diffusion](https://github.com/tanelp/tiny-diffusion) model to train a model on Datasaurus dataset and fine-tune it using RWR method to ignore its hands.
